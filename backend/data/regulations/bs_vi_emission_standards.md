# BS-VI Emission Standards

## Section 4.2.1: Idle Emission Limits

Commercial vehicles operating in metropolitan zones are subject to the following idle emission restrictions:

### Maximum Continuous Idle Duration

- **Metro Zones**: 90 seconds maximum continuous idling
- **Highway Rest Areas**: 180 seconds maximum continuous idling
- **Loading/Unloading Zones**: 300 seconds maximum (with documentation)

### Idle Emission Rates

A BS-VI compliant diesel heavy commercial vehicle produces approximately:

- **8.5 grams CO₂ per second** during idle
- **0.02 grams NOx per second** during idle
- **0.001 grams PM per second** during idle

### Violations

Exceeding the maximum continuous idle duration constitutes a Class B environmental violation subject to:

- First offense: Written warning
- Second offense: ₹5,000 fine
- Third offense: ₹15,000 fine and 24-hour vehicle impound

## Section 5.1.2: Emission Rate Standards

### CO₂ Emission Limits by Vehicle Class

| Vehicle Class | Max g CO₂/km (Unloaded) | Max g CO₂/km (Loaded) |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| LCV (<3.5t)   | 180                     | 220                   |
| MCV (3.5-12t) | 450                     | 550                   |
| HCV (>12t)    | 650                     | 850                   |

### Load Adjustment Formula

For heavy commercial vehicles, the adjusted emission limit is calculated as:

```
Adjusted_Limit = Base_Limit + (Load_kg / 1000) × 25 g/km
```

### Speed Efficiency Guidelines

Optimal fuel efficiency and emission performance occurs at:

- **Minimum**: 40 km/h
- **Maximum**: 70 km/h

Operating outside this range incurs efficiency penalties:

- Below 40 km/h: +15% emissions (stop-start cycles)
- Above 70 km/h: +8% emissions per 10 km/h (aerodynamic drag)

## Section 6.3: Green Zone Regulations

### Definition

Green Zones are designated urban areas with enhanced emission restrictions:

- Central Business Districts
- Hospital Zones (500m radius)
- School Zones (300m radius)
- Heritage Sites (as designated)

### Additional Restrictions

Within Green Zones:

1. Maximum idle time reduced to **60 seconds**
2. Only BS-VI compliant vehicles permitted
3. Real-time emission monitoring required
4. Speed limit: 30 km/h maximum

## Section 8.1: Monitoring Requirements

### Fleet Operators with >5 Vehicles

Must implement:

- GPS tracking with 5-second update intervals
- Real-time emission monitoring systems
- Automated alert systems for violations
- Monthly emission reports to transport authority

### Data Retention

- Raw telemetry data: 6 months minimum
- Aggregated emission reports: 5 years minimum
- Violation records: 10 years minimum
